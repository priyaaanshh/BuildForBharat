# Conversational Interface Hackathon Project

## Problem Statement

### Problem Name:
Conversational Interface

### Description of the Problem Statement:
In the world of online shopping, customers often face the challenge of not being able to 'look & feel' the product from the comfort of their homes. This lack of physical interaction creates ambiguity, and customers may be unsure whether their purchase is the right fit for them. Building trust in online marketplaces, especially in a country like India where physical shopping experiences are prevalent, remains a significant challenge. Non-tech savvy users, in particular, find it challenging to navigate through non-intuitive online interfaces.

The goal of this hackathon is to address these challenges by creating a conversational interface that serves as a guide for non-tech savvy buyers during their online shopping journey. This interface should not only offer guidance but also provide an immersive experience, mimicking the real-world "shopping feel." This immersive experience is especially crucial for fashion shopping, allowing buyers to virtually "try out" the products before making a purchase decision.

The conversational interface should enable interaction through natural language speech or text and similar intuitive interfaces, making the online shopping experience more accessible and enjoyable.

### Solution Expected & Deliverables:
Participants are expected to showcase a solution that provides a conversational interface meeting the following requirements:

1. **Conversational Interface:** Develop a system that facilitates natural language speech or text interaction, guiding users through the online shopping process.

2. **Immersive Experience:** Implement features that provide users with a realistic "shopping feel," particularly in the context of fashion shopping where virtual try-ons enhance the purchasing experience.

3. **Elaboration of Artefacts:** Clearly document all artifacts used in the solution, including technologies, libraries, and frameworks.

4. **Assumption Elaboration:** Provide detailed explanations of any assumptions made during the development of the conversational interface.

Participants are encouraged to think creatively and innovatively to deliver a solution that not only addresses the stated requirements but also enhances the overall online shopping experience for a diverse user base.
