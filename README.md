# Project Name: ShopTalk - Conversational Shopping Assistant

## Problem Statement

### Problem Name:
Conversational Interface

### Description of the Problem Statement:
In the era of online shopping, customers often face challenges in building trust and experiencing products remotely. The lack of a physical touch and feel aspect leads to uncertainties about the suitability of their purchases. This issue is particularly pronounced in India, where customers traditionally rely on in-person shopping experiences to build trust in both the product and the seller. Furthermore, non-tech-savvy users struggle with navigating non-intuitive online interfaces.

The objective is to develop a conversational interface that addresses these challenges. The ideal solution should guide non-tech-savvy buyers through the online shopping experience and provide an immersive feeling akin to real-world shopping. This immersive experience is especially beneficial for fashion shopping, allowing buyers to virtually "try out" products before making a purchase. The conversational interface should facilitate interaction through natural language speech or text, as well as other intuitive interfaces.
